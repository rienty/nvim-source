Install from source
-------------------

See the [Building Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim) wiki page and [supported platforms](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms) for details.

The build is CMake-based, but a Makefile is provided as a convenience.
After installing the dependencies, run the following command.

    make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    sudo make install

To install to a non-default location:

    make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo 
    make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/full/path/of/target install

No internet for the build:

    mkdir -p build
    touch build/.ran-deps-cmake
    cd build && cmake -G 'Ninja' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo /path/of/neovim-source
    touch .ran-cmake
    cd ..
    ninja -C build
